**Key Considerations**

    How will your app handle data persistence?

        ● App uses room database and view model implementation for data persistence

        ● News Are Stored in the Room Database for offline reading


**Describe any edge or corner cases in the UX.**

        ● User Navigate To Different Options like top News and Categories through

        ● Navigation Drawer

        ● You can Navigate to Details Activity By Clicking on the List Item

        ● The user can also click the home screen widget to open top headlines activity.

        ● Due to limited API usage rules the content of news is truncated thus to see full news user need to click read more.

        ● The App Enable RTL Support For Every Layout

        ● The App Increase Accessibility by using contentDescription for images loading
    
**Describe any libraries you’ll be using and share your reasoning for including them.**

        1. Picasso for loading images and caching them.[v2.5.2]

        2. Retrofit for implementing networking tasks[v2.4.0]

        3. Using Room database for data persistence[v1.1.1]

        4. Google Ads Service[v17.1.0]

        5. Google Analytic Service[v16.0.4]


**Describe how you will implement Google Play Services or other external services.**

        ● The app uses google analytics for error reporting

        ● Uses google ads for showing ads(Test ad) ,I will integrate ads at relevant places where it
          doesn’t interrupt user
    
**Next Steps: Required Tasks**
